Follow these directions to start the blog:

1. Make sure that MongoDB is running on ``localhost:27017``. `Download MongoDB
   <www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_ if you don't have it installed already.

2. Install prerequisite software: this example depends on `flask`_ and
   `pymodm`_. You can install these dependencies automatically by running ``pip
   install -r requirements.txt``.
