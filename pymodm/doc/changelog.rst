Version 0.4.1
-------------

This release includes a number of bug-fixes and improvements, including:

* Improve documentation.
* Improved support defining models before calling
  :meth:`~pymodm.connection.connect`.
* A field's :meth:`~pymodm.base.fields.MongoBaseField.to_python` method is no
  longer called on every access. It is only called on the first access after a
  call to :meth:`~pymodm.MongoModel.refresh_from_db` or, on the
  first access after a field is set.
* Fixed bug when appending to an empty :class:`~pymodm.fields.ListField`.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

This release fixes a couple problems from the previous 0.3 release and adds a
number of new features, including:

* Support for callable field defaults.
* Change default values for DictField, OrderedDictField, ListField, and
  EmbeddedDocumentListField to be the empty value for their respective
  containers instead of None.
* Add the `ignore_unknown_fields`
  :ref:`metadata attribute <metadata-attributes>` which allows unknown
  fields when parsing documents into a :class:`~pymodm.MongoModel`.
  Note that with this option enabled, calling :meth:`~pymodm.MongoModel.save`
  will erase these fields for that model instance.
* Add :meth:`pymodm.queryset.QuerySet.reverse`.
* Properly check that the `mongo_name` parameter to
  :class:`~pymodm.base.fields.MongoBaseField`
  and all keys in :class:`~pymodm.fields.DictField` and
  :class:`~pymodm.fields.OrderedDictField` are valid MongoDB field names.
* Fix multiple issues in dereferencing fields thanks to
  https://github.com/ilex.
